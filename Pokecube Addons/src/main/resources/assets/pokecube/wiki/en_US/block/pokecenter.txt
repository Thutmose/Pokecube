[prefix{l}]Pokecenter Block[prefix{r}]
This block is used to Heal your Pokemobs.
Simply place the pokecubes in the slots, and press the heal button.
If this block is receiving direct Redstone power, it will play a loop of music.  In the ones which spawn naturally, simply remove the power source, and they will stop playing.
